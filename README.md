Hi there 👋
About Me
💻 I’m a third-year Information Technology undergraduate with a strong passion for software development and a curiosity for emerging technologies.

🌱 Actively improving my skills in software development , web development, AI projects , and mobile app development through hands-on projects and continuous learning.

💡 I enjoy building real-world applications that solve meaningful problems and thrive in collaborative environments where I can learn and contribute.

🚀 Key Projects

**Medical Center Management System** 🏥 – An end-to-end web application developed as my individual third-year software development project. The system was built using Next.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, with MySQL as the primary database and Firebase used for implementing a real-time appointment system. It includes features such as patient management, appointment scheduling, prescription tracking, and staff management. I handled the entire development lifecycle, from requirement analysis to design, development, and deployment.

**GoodEats** – A feature-rich recipe sharing app built using Java and Firebase. Includes user authentication, recipe CRUD operations, image uploads, and social features like ratings and reviews.

**Food Demand Predictor** – A machine learning project using Linear Regression to forecast weekly food demand. Trained on a large Kaggle dataset and deployed with Flask on a web interface.

**Employee Management System** – A full-stack web application built with React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB to manage employee records, tasks, and attendance, developed as part of a collaborative university project.
